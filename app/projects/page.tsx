            I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects through the
            years. Currently, I am most interested in projects relating to
            decentralization, knowledge sharing, and democratizing access to
            information.

            I am in the process of updating this with current and previous
            projects. My goal is to include case studies for featured projects.

The DAOhaus Yeeter is an open source, trustless crowdfunding platform for bootstrapping web3 projects. Each project funded through the Yeeter becomes a DAO on the DAOhaus platform. I contributed as a frontend engineer in our push to launch prior to Eth Denver 2022. The Yeeter was built to dogfood our own fundraising needs for building DAOhaus v3. We wanted to build a tool to facilitate alternative fundraising methods, such as a community raise.

The Yeeter app interacts with several smart contracts:  [MolochV2.5](https://github.com/HausDAO/Moloch2.5/blob/main/contracts/MolochSummoner.sol), the [Yeeter.sol](https://github.com/HausDAO/Moloch2.5/blob/main/contracts/Yeeter.sol) contract, the [Safe Minion](https://github.com/HausDAO/MinionSummonerV2) contract, and the [Gnosis Safe](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts) contract. The frontend is built with React and ChakraUI with the goal of providing a clean, effective interface for a relatively complex user experience.
